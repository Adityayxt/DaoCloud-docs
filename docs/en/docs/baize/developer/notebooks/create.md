# Create Notebook

Notebook provides an online web interactive programming environment, making it convenient for developers to quickly conduct data science and machine learning experiments.

Upon entering the developer console, developers can create and manage Notebooks in different clusters and namespaces.

1. Click **Notebooks** in the left navigation bar to enter the Notebook list. Click the **Create** button on the right.

2. The system will pre-fill basic configuration data, including the cluster to deploy to, namespace, Notebook image address, queue, resources, user directory, etc. Adjust these parameters and click **Confirm**.

3. The newly created Notebook will initially be in the **Pending** state, and will change to **Running** after a moment, with the latest one appearing at the top of the list by default.

4. Click the **â‹®** on the right side to perform more actions: update parameters, start/stop, view workload details, and delete.
