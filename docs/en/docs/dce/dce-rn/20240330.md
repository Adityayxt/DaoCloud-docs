## Upgrade Notes

- **Container Management** : When upgrading from v0.21.x to v0.22.0 or higher, if the Global cluster uses
  Redis in sentinel mode, you need to change **--set global.db.redis.url** during the upgrade.
- **Global Management** : When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower versions) to v0.21.0 (or higher versions),
  the database connection Helm parameter format needs to be modified. For details, refer to
  [Offline Upgrade of Global Management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md).
- **Workbench** : When upgrading from versions before v0.21.0 to this version, GitOps applications
  may disappear. It is recommended not to upgrade to this version directly, but upgrade to v0.22.0
  or later versions.
- **Redis Cache Service** : When upgrading from Redis v0.14.0 to v0.15.0, because this iteration
  includes the upgrade of Redis Operator, the cluster of Redis standalone and master-slave mode
  will be restarted during the upgrade ！！！！
