## Network Requirements

### Network Topology

Assuming VIP is used as the load balancing method for the global cluster:

![Network-Topology](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/install/commercial/images/Network-Topology.png)

### Network Requirements

| Resource | Requirements | Description |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `istioGatewayVip` | 1 | If the load balancing mode is metallb, a VIP needs to be specified for the UI interface and OpenAPI access entry of DCE. |
| `insightVip` | 1 | If the load balancing mode is metallb, a VIP needs to be specified for the insight data collection entry of the global cluster. The insight-agent of the sub-cluster can report data to this VIP. |
| Network Speed | 1000 M/s | Not less than 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps is recommended |
| Protocol | - | Supports IPv6 |
| Reserved IP Address Ranges | 2 | Used by Pods (default is 10.233.64.0/18) and Services (default is 10.233.0.0/18). If they are already in use, you can define other IP address ranges to avoid IP address conflicts. |
| Routing | - | Servers have default routes or routes pointing to the 0.0.0.0 address. |
| NTP Server Address | 1~4 | Make sure that there are accessible NTP server IP addresses in your data center. |
| DNS Server Address | 1~2 | If your applications require DNS services, prepare accessible DNS server IP addresses. |

## Client Browser Requirements

- Firefox **≥** v49
- Chrome **≥** v54
