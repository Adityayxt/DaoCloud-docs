# Network Challenges in Multicloud and Multicluster Environments

## Network Connectivity Across Multicluster and Multicloud

In multicluster environments, ensuring seamless connectivity goes beyond merely using different network CNIs
for each cluster. It involves enabling effective inter-cluster communication, which necessitates resolving
issues related to Cluster IP and DNS interoperability.

## Unified IP Resource Management

Achieving network interoperability in multicloud and multicluster setups requires meticulous IP management
to prevent duplication or conflicts within and across clusters. IP management and planning must consider
a multicluster perspective to avoid conflicts in IP addresses and network segments (Underlay IP, Service IP, etc.).

## Challenges with a Single CNI Solution

Given the diversity of network use cases and the varying network requirements of different types of applications,
it is challenging for a single CNI to satisfy all needs. Specific CNIs may be necessary for particular business
requirements, and combining multiple CNIs may be required for more complex scenarios.

## Demand for Fixed and Externally Accessible IPs

There is a significant demand for fixed and externally accessible IPs, typically managed via Underlay CNI.
However, IP resources in Underlay CNI are limited and subject to strict firewall control.
This necessitates careful planning and allocation of Underlay IPs. Efficient mechanisms must be
in place to promptly recover IPs when release and allocation processes fail, to prevent resource wastage.

## Unified Management of Network Security Policies and Traffic

It is crucial to standardize the distribution of network security policies across different clusters
and to manage and encrypt network traffic between them effectively. This unified approach helps in
maintaining consistent security protocols and efficient traffic management.

## Integrating New Technologies: Challenges and Opportunities

Adapting to high-performance and low-latency network demands often involves integrating
hardware-based virtualization acceleration solutions like SR-IOV and software-based
network acceleration technologies such as eBPF. This integration presents significant
opportunities and challenges, particularly in the context of cloud-native container networks,
requiring a balanced approach to leverage these advanced technologies effectively.
