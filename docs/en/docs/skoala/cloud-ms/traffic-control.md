# Service Governance

Service governance allows you to manage the east-west traffic of microservices imported from the [DCE 5.0 Service Mesh](../../mspider/intro/index.md) based on features of Service Mesh.

After [microservices](index.md) are imported, different east-west traffic policies can be set individually for each exposed port of the service.

1. Click the service name.
