# Add domain name

The microservice gateway supports the full lifecycle management of domain names, including adding, updating, and deleting domain names. Through domain name management, you can apply a domain name to multiple apis of the gateway and configure gateway policies at the domain name level. This page explains how to add a domain name.

To add a domain name, perform the following steps:

1. Click the name of the target gateway to enter the gateway overview page. Then click __Domain Management__ in the left navigation bar and __Add Domain__ in the upper right corner of the page.

2. Fill in the configuration information

    The domain name configuration information consists of `Basic Info` (mandatory) and `Policy Settings` (optional) and `Security Settings`(optional).

    - Domain name: cannot be modified after a domain name is created.
    - Protocol: HTTP is selected by default. If you select HTTPS, you need to provide an HTTPS certificate.

        > Currently, only existing certificates can be selected. Automatic certificate issuance and manual certificate upload features are being developed.
