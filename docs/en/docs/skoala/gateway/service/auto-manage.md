# Automatic management service

The services that are successfully added will be displayed on the service list page. You can also select the services in the list as the target back-end services when adding apis. The microservice gateway supports manual access and automatic management to add services. This page describes how to automatically manage services.

After [created a gateway](../index.md) succeeds, the services in the service source are automatically added to the service list of the gateway instance without manual addition.
