# Microservice Engine

DaoCloud Microservice Engine is a one-stop microservice management platform for mainstream microservice ecosystems
in the industry. It mainly provides two dimensions of functionalities: Microservice Governance Center and
Microservice Gateway. It covers various management scenarios throughout the microservice lifecycle, including
service registration and discovery, configuration management, traffic governance, service-level tracing, API management,
domain management, monitoring, and alerting. The Microservice Engine has strong compatibility and can seamlessly
integrate with other components of DCE 5.0. It also perfectly supports open-source ecosystems such as Spring Cloud
and Dubbo, helping you to build your own microservice system using open-source microservice technologies more conveniently.
